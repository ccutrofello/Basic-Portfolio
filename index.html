    <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>I was born and rasied in New Jersey, but have spent the last twenty years living up and down the East Coast. Four years ago 
        I moved to North Carolina and I don't intend to leave.  I'm an avid lover of all things outdoors, camping, hiking, swimming, boating,
        and pretty much anything else that involves fresh air. I'm a proud movie geek, I like to tell people that I spent a brief time working
        in the movie industry (as an assitant manager of a Blockbuster Video many moons ago). I'm engaged to a wonderful woman and will hopefully
        be married within the next year.
